# Status

- [x] Monero Stratum Protocol
- [x] CryptoNight Hash
- [ ] Integrating with Node.js
- [ ] Working Release

# kNight.js

kNight.js is one of the first completely free alternatives to coin-hive as a CryptoNight miner.

We believe that mining will eventually replace Ads as a way to generate revenue for sites.

## Acknowledgements

The CryptoNight hash used is largely copied from [notgiven688/webminerpool](https://github.com/notgiven688/webminerpool/tree/master/hash_cn/webassembly) which is based on the Monero code.
